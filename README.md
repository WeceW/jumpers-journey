# Jumper's Journey
> Coursework for Fundamentals of Game Development (LUT University).
> My very first game made with Unity

The gameâ€™s idea was to be a simple old-school-ish 2D-platformer. Player moves and jumps around the game area and collects different items to strengthen its physical powers (i.e. jumping abilities).
